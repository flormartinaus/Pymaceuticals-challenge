# Pymaceuticals-challenge

In this study, 249 mice with SCC developing tumours were given a variety of treatment regimens. Tumour development was tracked and measured over the period of 45 days. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Pymaceuticals' medicine of interest, Capomulin, to the effectiveness of the other treatment regimens. 

 

## Observations and Insights

* Capomulin and Ramicane shrink tumour size more effectively.

* The relationship between mouse weight and average tumour volume is 0.84. The average tumour volume increases as the mouse's weight increases. A correlation of 0.84 indicates a relatively significant positive link. 

* According to the bar graph, Capomulin and Ramicane had the most mice studied.
