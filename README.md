# Pymaceuticals-challenge

In this study, 249 mice with SCC developing tumours were given a variety of treatment regimens. Tumour development was tracked and measured over the period of 45 days. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Pymaceuticals' medicine of interest, Capomulin, to the effectiveness of the other treatment regimens. 

The following visualizations were created: 
* Summary statistics dataframe

* Bar plot showing  the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen throughout the course of the study

* Pie chart showing the distribution of female or male mice in the study

* Box plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens

* Line plot of volume versus timepoint for Capomulin treatmeant of mouse l509

* Scatter plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen

* Linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment plotted on top of the scatter plot

## Observations and Insights

* Capomulin and Ramicane shrink tumour size more effectively.

* The relationship between mouse weight and average tumour volume is 0.84. The average tumour volume increases as the mouse's weight increases. A correlation of 0.84 indicates a relatively significant positive link. 

* According to the bar graph, Capomulin and Ramicane had the most mice studied.
